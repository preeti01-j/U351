The K. L. E. Society started in 1916 by seven dedicated teachers and three generous patrons. Their mission was to provide education, to the children of the farming community in Karnataka and Maharashtra. The environment today is totally different from the one in 1916, yet the mission of the founder of K. L. E. Society is pursued with the same zeal even after nine decades in the fulfillment of the vision of providing education to the needy in all spheres of human knowledge.

K.L.E Society's Polytechnic Mahalingapur is expected to blossom into an institution par excellence and working efficiently to achieve proficiency in technical education. With the past year of fruitful and dedicated service, it has earned enviable reputation, It is only because of the untiring efforts of the local governing Body, whole-hearted support rendered by the Board of management K.L.E Society's Belgaum, with good team work of the faculty and healthy co-operation of the students.
The vision
The purpose of Letusstudy.in is to provide the best options for the students to choose from thousands of colleges in a simple way and to procure admission with a single click of a mouse, further providing a platform to involve the student interaction for the betterment of the college they choose to study.

Let us study is a subsidiary of LUDY EDUCATIONAL SERVICES PVT LTD, we have been providing excellent guidance to the students for the past 10 years in India. We have provided guidance to more than 3000 students directly who have pursued their careers in the top colleges in India. Although we have always tried to provide maximum service to the students the reach was very low most of the students were unaware of the services and the quality of our services. This was because of the vast number of students and the limited facilities due to a shortage of manpower and other resources.  

What we found
What we have felt all the way long is that there has been a gap between the students and colleges. Although many colleges had excellent facilities and vacant seats the aspiring student will never know about the seat vacancy in the colleges and donâ€™t know how to get admission. Maybe sometimes they are misled to join poor standard colleges at higher fees. The information that was available to the students was never genuine or accurate. This led to the formation of the Let us study.in
